DevZone Breakout Hands-on Workshops
===================================
This year in the DevZone we are doing a solution based workshop program similar to hands-on training (aka HOTs) but with a broader scope for the content. There will be 4 workshop tracks tailored for makers of all skill sets to gain relevant app development skills at Dreamforce. 

These workshops will be 2.5 hours long (same as the HOTs) and consist of instructor lead sections followed by hands-on exercises. There will be one instructor per course, staffers in each room to help facilitate questions during the hands-on exercises, and the potential to seat about 100 students per workshop. All of the course material and demos will be provided, but the instructor can add their own flavor and personal experience to each workshop to make it their own.

#Tracks#
The 4 tracks cycling throughout Dreamforce will be:
#### Introduction to Point-And-Click App Building 

Are you a new Salesforce Admin or a Super User looking to understand the power of the creating an application with point-and-click tools on the Force.com platform? This session is for you! The goal of this session is to help familiarize you what tools exist on the platform and how you can use them to build an app without writing a single line of code. In addition, in each lesson you'll get hands-on and build a sustainable app that you can put to work today. At the end of the workshop, you will feel empowered about point-and-click app building, confident in your ability to streamline business process, and be engaged with Salesforce. <br>
#### Coding on Force.com for Admins and Non-Developers  

Are you a Salesforce point-and-click guru looking to learn more about the programmatic features of the platform? Are you interested in learning how to code but have no formal coding background? If you answered yes to these questions, this workshop is for you! The goal of this workshop is to empower admins and declarative developers to be able to analyze code and assess what it does, outline and use the available tools to tinker on existing code to modify functionality, and set a foundation for being able to build your own triggers and test classes. This workshop will teach you not only what programmatic tools exist and when you can use them, but also give context into where these features extend the limitations of the point-and-click tools you are already using today. <br>
#### Fast Track to Salesforce Application Development 

Are you an experienced developer who is new to the Salesforce1 Platform? If so, this workshop is for you! This workshop will introduce you to the fundamentals of Salesforce application development to fast ramp your productivity and shorten your learning curve. You will learn how to use the key building blocks of the platform: Visualforce Pages to create rich user interfaces, SOQL to access data, and Apex to create classes and database triggers. In this hands-on workshop, you will use all of these tools to build a complete conference management application that manages sessions, speakers, and speaker assignments. By the end of this workshop, you’ll be ready to start developing your own application productively. <br>
#### A Deeper Dive into Salesforce Application Development 

Are you a seasoned Salesforce Developer looking to learn some more advanced development skills? Join us and expand your horizons! In this workshop you’ll learn how to build engaging Salesforce applications using some of today’s trending technologies and frameworks. You will learn how to build JavaScript and “Single Page Applications” on top of the Salesforce1 platform, how to use the REST APIs to connect to Salesforce from external applications or devices, and how to integrate existing applications into Salesforce using Force.com Canvas. By the end of this workshop, you’ll be ready to start using Salesforce in more unexpected ways and in more unexpected places. <br>

#Content#
For these workshops, we will provide you with content to run the workshop. What will we give you?
* DEs loaded with samples for demos and demo data
* A Powerpoint presentation correlating to the curriculum and hands-on material
* A workbook (digital and hardcopy) with exercises for the students to go through

These content materials are not rigid. I would encourage you (if you want to lead a workshop) to use personal stories of your own career path, problems you've ran into on the job, tips & tricks you wish someone shared with you, etc to make this presentation your own. In addition, if you think you have cool (yet simple) demos that would drive a point home moreso than the demos provided, I would love to see it.

The goal of this workshop is to get more developers hands-on with app development at Dreamforce, feel competent enough when they go home to dig in where they are most interested, and leave with both a sense of understanding and imagination as to what they could potentially do on the Salesforce1 platform for their company.

#Influitive Challenge#
